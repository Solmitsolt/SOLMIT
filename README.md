SOLMIT

In the age of digitalization, the SOLMIT platform wants to open the door for this multidisciplinary industry in the insurance and financial services industry to enter the transparent and decentralized world of block-chain. And offer far better, faster, safer, and less expensive services.

To date, different crypto currencies have been presented with different roles and applications. Except for a few of them, they have not been felt in the real world and have not solved a problem yet.

The SOLMIT project, came into being with the slogan "Idea is not important, implementation is important." to introduce block-chain technology into people’s lives and make it affordable and effortless. The traditional insurance and financial services industry have so many problems. The SOLMIT project has plans and ideas to solve these problems.
SOLT
The SOMIT token was created in March 2022.

Total number of tokens:

2000,000,000 SOLMIT

The number of tokens is limited to this value and no new tokens will be generated. (Mint)

Function of SOLMIT Crypto Currency

Sticking: SOLMIT-specific block-chain rewards people who deposit SOLMIT passwords in the form of the same token in exchange for user participation in the consensus process and strengthening network security.

The SOLMIT currency code in its dedicated network will play the role of liquidity for insurance companies and tokens to pay premiums and possible damages.

The SOLMIT
currency code will be in the form of a local investment token for investing in digital currencies by financial institutions and insurance companies. Given the growing number of institutional investors in digital currencies and the allocation of part of the capital to this industry, we envision a bright future for BTC in this area.

Why SOLMIT in a Multi-chain Ecosystem?



•	With the advent of multi-chain technology and interoperability between them, developers are realizing the value of multi-block ecosystem rather than choosing a block-chain to develop decentralized applications. The purpose of this technology is to ensure that all networks can work together to improve the industry.



•	The more block chains, the more value



•	It is inevitable that the projects will eventually connect several block-chains and transfer data from one chain to another without any problems. As the multi-chain ecosystem unfolds, it becomes clear that its additional features, usability and scalability will help welcome new users.



•	Instead of doubting the existence of a multi-block ecosystem, it should be viewed positively. There are many different smart contract platforms, all of which are influential in terms of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and innovation in the block-chain world. Block-chains may be fragmented right now, but everything eventually comes together to create a fast, cooperative protocol network that meets our daily needs. The beauty of this is that we do not have to worry about how the transactions are done or the network in which we trade.

















•	Multi-cain helps developers to use multi-block chain ecosystems to develop decentralized applications.

•	These block-chains work internally. The multi-block-chain platform essentially has a simple API interface that defines the command line. This platform is suitable for financial transactions.

•	Multi-chain has a variety of features, including license management, native assets, simple configuration, etc. in each chain. These high-level features can help organizations' applications for greater scalability, confidentiality, integration, and compatibility.

•	Multi-block chain, as a private network, has a very simple structure, practicality and good flexibility.

•	It is possible to use different programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C and Ruby in this network. The main purpose of this technology is to ensure the proper functioning of all networks to improve the industry.

•	Indigenous tokens in Multi-chain, called assets, can be generated and exchanged between stakeholders. Such a block-chain reflects some of the features of SOLMIT, and with the development of the SOLMIT protocol and its APIs, the network can be adapted to a wide range of tools and open source code built for SOLMIT.

•	Features available on these networks include software libraries, online browsers, mobile wallets, and hardware security tools.

•	Users or Network Nodes only need to connect or communicate. Thus, all systems that install or connect to this software to use an in-house multi-chain network have the same database of transactions.
